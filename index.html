<h1>East Coast Lifestyle.</h1>
    
<hr>
    
<p><em>East Coast Lifestyle</em> was created by an Acadia student in the classroom. Alex Maclean started the brand with just 30 hoodies and has turned ECL into a serious movement.</p> 
    
<p>Born and raised at the heart of the east coast in Nova Scotia, ECL was founded on the basis that people want to wear and represent something that matters more to them than the average logo. By creating a great product that promotes a great place, we made something special. People came together to stand for where they come from and a movement began.</p>
    
<p>Recognizable athletes and actors such as <strong>Sidney Crosby, Nathan MacKinnon, Tig From Son's Of Anarchy and Classified</strong> support and wear the clothing line, but our mission is to give back to a place that has given so much to us, and that comes full-circle through the community outreach program. We came together in the belief that we are the East Coast and are dedicated to always support the community in different ways. At the beginning, the brand was started as a school project by a passionate 21 year old student but we ended up starting a movement.</p>

<p><em>“I really wanted to create a clothing line for the east coast, because Maritimers are a very proud people,” says MacLean. “I wanted to make clothing that they could wear wherever they are, to show off their Maritime pride.”</em></p>
